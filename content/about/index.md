Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of [Maths](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15h9Gz045CkqvyadtdMqCstNRgOX2RXDx/view?usp=sharing) in my high school and got introduced to `competitive programming` in my freshman year at [Parul University](https://paruluniversity.ac.in/). I later achieved the rating of [4â˜… @CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/ayon_ssp) and began exploring `Open source` development. I became an active member of [RandomCoderOrg](https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg), where we developed a project to run Ubuntu on Android, and achieved [~900 + stars](https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android) on GitHub. Since then, I have also been actively solving problems based on `Data Structures and Algorithms`. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/Ayon_ssp/).

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in **Computer Science and Engineering** (2020-2024) with [8.69 GPA aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iu2usecTJv97dOcOub41hjpXQhw2bdGj/view?usp=sharing).

<!-- I also have knowledge of **Web Development** and have created several projects using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js, Node.js, Django, and PostgreSQL. I'm also part of some student organisations and Leading one of them. -->

**Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.**
