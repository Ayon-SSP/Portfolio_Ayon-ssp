Hello! Interestingly, I have been a student of Maths in my high school and got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Parul University](https://paruluniversity.ac.in/). My interest in coding started back in 2020 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/Ayon_ssp/).

Today, I'm currently pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024) with [8.69 GPA aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Iu2usecTJv97dOcOub41hjpXQhw2bdGj/view?usp=sharing).

I also have knowledge of web development and have created several projects using React.js, Node.js, Django, and PostgreSQL. I am an active member of the [RandomCoderOrg](https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg) GitHub organization dedicated to `open source`.

Here is a list of the technologies that I've worked with.
