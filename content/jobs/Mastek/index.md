- During my three-month internship at Mastek, a Multinational IT company, I worked on Oracle Database, SQL & PL/SQL, JDBC, Core Java, OOPs, MVC, Java Advanced concepts including XML, and Web services. Also worked on JSP basics.
- Leading a team of 5 interns to develop an Online Bookstore Management System, demonstrating expertise in database design, developing APIs, and Oracle DB.

#### Key Achievements:
1. User Authentication
2. Scalability and Performance
3. Book Catalog Management
4. Order Processing
5. Admin Functionality

I've developed a robust web application named `Book Store Management System` utilizing **Java**, **JSP**, **Servlets**, and **Oracle database**. Adhering to **industry best practices**, I've implemented object-oriented principles and adopted the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture**.

### The application's features include:

**Book Catalog Management:**
1. Admin functionality allows for the addition of new books to the catalog, with details such as title, author, genre, and price being specified.
2. The system seamlessly updates the book inventory and reflects new additions on the website, ensuring real-time accuracy.

**Order Processing:**
1. Customers can easily browse the bookstore website and add desired books to their shopping cart.
2. During the checkout process, the system calculates the total cost, applies any applicable discounts, and generates an order confirmation for the customer's reference.
3. Admin privileges extend to order processing, enabling inventory updates and proactive communication with customers regarding their order status, including shipping details and delivery estimates.

Throughout the development process, I meticulously **designed the database schema**, **implemented JDBC** for seamless interaction with the database, and **crafted well-structured Models, DAO (Data Access Object) classes, as well as collection and service layers**. These components integrate seamlessly with Servlets and JSP pages, ensuring a cohesive and efficient user experience.
