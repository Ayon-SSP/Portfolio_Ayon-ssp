<!-- > React.js, JSON Web Token (JWT) -->

- During my three-month internship at Enitiate, a dynamic product-based startup, I specialized in developing authentication and security pages using [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) with [React.js](https://legacy.reactjs.org/). This hands-on experience allowed me to enhance my skills in web development and security protocols.
- I actively contributed to the product's integrity and user authentication features.
- My time at Enitiate not only deepened my technical proficiency but also provided valuable insights into the **fast-paced startup environment**.
